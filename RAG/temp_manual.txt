    STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: ACID-BASE TITRATION
    
    1. Preparation:
       - Rinse the burette with distilled water, then with the standard base solution (NaOH).
       - Fill the burette with NaOH. Eliminate air bubbles.
       - Record INITIAL READING (V1).
       
    2. Flask Setup:
       - Pipette 25mL of unknown acid (HCl) into a clean conical flask.
       - Add 2-3 drops of Phenolphthalein indicator. Solution should be COLORLESS.
       
    3. Titration:
       - Place flask under burette over a white tile.
       - Add NaOH slowly while SWIRLING the flask constantly.
       - Slow down to drop-wise addition as the endpoint approaches (flash of pink).
       
    4. Endpoint:
       - Stop when a FAINT PINK color persists for at least 30 seconds.
       - Record FINAL READING (V2).
       - Verify: V2 - V1 = Titer value.
       
    SAFETY:
    - Wear safety goggles at all times.
    - If acid spills on skin, wash immediately with water.
    - Never pipette by mouth.
